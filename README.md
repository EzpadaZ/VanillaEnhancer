### Minecraft Spigot Plugin for Spigot 1.20/1.20.1
This is not a published plugin nor does it have a current goal set, this is just a test for me to learn Minecraft Plugin Development as a hobby.
The features it provides are a bunch of random stuff my friends have asked and/or i wanted to implement based on the needs of our server.



## Features
- Double XP Events (Scheduled with other plugin)
- Travel commands.
- Gameplay enhancements and other plugin fixes (since they dont give a fuck.)
- MongoDB Telemetry

## Planned
- Banking System (Store and Receive Gold wich is used for travels)
- Banking Exchange System (Trade gold Exp)'
- Mailing System (send and receive items without needing to travel)
- DeathChest (Have a chest where your stuff goes, in exchange of gold or experience points)
- Backpack System
- More Gameplay Changes (small, but changes anyways.)
- Integration with ReviveMe to prevent deaths (in exchange of experience or gold)
- Integration with PlaceholderAPI
- Manage config from MongoDB directly to allow an API to be built and monitor/change plugin settings without requiring reload.
